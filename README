The Vocabular Tester is meant to test your ability to recall,
verbatim, specific answers to specific prompts.  The tests work
recursively; if you get all the prompts correct in any round, then you
are done with that round.  Otherwise, a new round is started which
tests you on the prompts that you got wrong in the current round, and
when that round is done, you have to do the current round again.
